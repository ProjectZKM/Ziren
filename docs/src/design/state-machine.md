# State Machine

MIPS VM is a register-based machine.

A machine is general-purpose computation system which consists of multiple chips, including CPU, Memory, Arithmetic etc.

Each chip is computing unit for specific purposes. Each chips consists of an execution trace table, a received/sent signal vector.
