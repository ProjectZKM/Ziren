# Optimizations

Log of measured prover optimizations. Each entry: what changed, the measured
delta, how it was validated, and the enable/kill-switch.

## Jagged-eval structural sumcheck — host-core parallelization

- **What.** `structural_jagged_eval_sumcheck` (`crates/pcs/src/jagged_eval_sumcheck.rs`)
  is the jagged-PCS eval sub-protocol. Its per-round work sums independent
  per-column contributions (`compute_round_evals`) and applies independent
  per-column EQ updates (`fold`). Both are now parallelized across host cores
  via a dedicated rayon pool (`jeval_pool`).
- **Why a dedicated pool.** The stage runs inside the single-thread basefold
  worker pool, so a bare `par_iter` there stays sequential. Routing to a
  dedicated all-core pool via `install()` uses the idle host cores while the
  GPU is idle.
- **Why byte-neutral.** Field addition is associative + commutative, so the
  rayon tree-reduce is byte-identical to the sequential fold. Only the
  inherently-serial round loop (challenger observe/sample) stays sequential.
- **Measured** (goat @2^22 single-GPU core, RTX 5090):
  - jagged-eval sumcheck: **13.4 s → 0.56 s (~24×)**
  - core wall: **~44.5 s → ~32.3 s (−27.5%)** (3 runs each)
  - This was the dominant single-GPU core host cost after the zerocheck-reduce
    fix (~30% of core; GPU ~65–76% idle during it).
- **Validated byte-identical.**
  - fib core proof sha == golden `6278c091` with the optimization on == off.
  - goat single-GPU core sha identical on == off under the deterministic
    `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` oracle (9 shards, both VERIFY OK).
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_JAGGED_EVAL_PAR` — default **on**; set `=0` (kill-switch) for the
    legacy sequential path.
  - `ZIREN_JAGGED_EVAL_THREADS` — override the pool thread count
    (default = host available parallelism).
  - 64-column floor: shards with `<64` columns stay sequential (the pool
    hand-off would dominate).

## LogUp-GKR eq-table build — O(2^n) incremental (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** `build_eq_row_host_from_point` (ziren-gpu
  `basefold/src/logup_round_device.rs`) builds the LSB-first partial-Lagrange
  (eq) table for each logup-GKR transition layer's per-round sumcheck. The
  previous build was **O(dim · 2^dim)** — it recomputed the full per-dimension
  product from scratch for each of the 2^dim entries. Replaced with an
  **O(2^dim)** incremental build that grows the table by doubling, reusing the
  partial products.
- **Why byte-neutral.** The incremental build accumulates the same
  per-dimension factors in the same order (`k = 0..dim`), so every entry is
  byte-identical to the naive build.
- **Measured** (goat @2^22 single-GPU core, RTX 5090):
  - eq-table build: **~6.9 s → ~0.45 s (~15×)**
  - core wall: **~32.3 s → ~26 s (~−19%)** (3 runs each)
  - This was the dominant single-GPU core host cost after the jagged-eval fix
    (~21% of core, hidden inside `layer_transitions`; the per-round device
    sumcheck itself was only ~0.8 s and the host Fiat-Shamir ~0, refuting a
    per-round-latency bottleneck — the cost was this host recompute).
- **Validated byte-identical.**
  - fib core proof sha == golden `6278c091` with the optimization on == off.
  - goat single-GPU core sha identical on == off under the deterministic
    `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` oracle (`a7af7687…`, 9 shards, both VERIFY OK).
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_EQ_INCREMENTAL` — default **on**; set `=0` (kill-switch) for the
    legacy naive build.

## Shard-verify concurrency cap — bound peak host RAM (host)

- **What.** Core-proof verification (`crates/pcs/src/machine.rs`) verified all
  shard proofs with a single unbounded `par_iter` over `shard_proofs`. Each
  `verify_shard` allocates a large transient (padded-dense-sized, ~18–20 GB)
  buffer; with a 41-shard tendermint proof on a high-core host all shards
  allocate at once → **~726 GB peak host RSS → OOM (RC=137)**. Replaced with a
  **chunked bounded-parallel** verify: at most `cap` shards verify concurrently.
- **Why byte-neutral.** Shards are independent. The chunked path collects the
  same set of failing shard indices, takes the same lowest index, and
  re-verifies it serially for the identical typed error. For `n ≤ cap` it
  reduces to exactly the original single `par_iter` (fib and other small proofs
  are bit-identical). This bounds memory only — verify is not a perf target.
- **Measured** (tendermint 41-shard core proof, with verify):
  - peak host RSS: **~726 GB (OOM) → ~156 GB** at cap=8 (~44 GB at cap=1).
  - core proof sha **32b38d48** (golden) preserved; VERIFY OK.
  - Unblocks full-tendermint `coreVerify` as an end-to-end byte-oracle
    (previously un-runnable due to the OOM).
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_VERIFY_SHARD_CONCURRENCY` — max concurrent shard verifies
    (default **8**); raise to trade host RAM for verify parallelism.

## LogUp-GKR first-layer device residency — skip giant-shard D2H (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** The giant GKR first layer (nv=30 circuit layers) was computed
  on-device, downloaded to a host `LayerState` (D2H ~1.5 s), then re-uploaded to
  build the sumcheck slab. `ZIREN_GPU_FIRST_LAYER_RESIDENT` keeps the
  first-layer split device-resident (device interaction-eval stash + device
  MSB-split), skipping the giant first-layer D2H + host re-upload on the shards
  that carry giant layers.
- **Why byte-neutral.** The on-device split produces the identical
  numerator/denominator quadrants as the host path — verified per-cell,
  0-mismatch on the giant nv=30 layer. A latent uninitialized-memory bug in the
  empty lower quadrants (device placeholder allocated but never written, vs the
  host zero-pad) was fixed by zeroing the placeholder; without it the
  giant-shard transcript diverged (coreVerify=0). The transcript never reads the
  host materialization, so eliminating it is byte-identical.
- **Measured** (tendermint 41-shard core proving, 2×GPU, skip-verify, RTX 5090):
  - core proving wall: **~115.8 s → ~110.0 s (~−5.0%)** (3 runs each, zero
    overlap — ON worst < OFF best, no OOM). The win is skipping the D2H +
    re-upload on the ~2–3 giant shards; goat (no giant nv=30 layers) is a wash.
- **Validated byte-identical.**
  - fib core proof sha == golden `6278c091` with default (RESIDENT-on).
  - goat single-GPU core sha identical default(on) == `=0`(off) == golden
    `a7af7687` under the `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` oracle, both VERIFY OK.
  - full-tendermint `coreVerify` RESIDENT-on: sha `32b38d48` (golden) + VERIFY
    OK — end-to-end on the giant nv=30 device-MSB-split path (runnable via the
    shard-verify concurrency cap above).
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_FIRST_LAYER_RESIDENT` — default **on**; set `=0` (kill-switch)
    for the legacy D2H + host-reupload path.

## Single-GPU inline basefold — eliminate the host trace re-upload (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** On single-GPU the deferred basefold queue pinned the device-trace
  provider at cap=2 (the 2 captured shards' traces are held until their deferred
  basefolds, which run only after *all* core proving). Shards 2..N then freed
  their device traces post-GKR and **re-uploaded** host `main_traces` (col-major
  transpose + H2D) for the reduce — ~20 s. `ZIREN_GPU_SINGLE_GPU_INLINE_BASEFOLD`
  runs each shard's basefold reduce **inline** (immediately after its
  core-proving + open) when `n_gpus==1`, so the shard's captured device traces
  feed its reduce directly (no re-upload) and release before the next shard
  (only 1 shard's traces resident).
- **Why single-GPU-only.** The deferral exists to overlap core-proving (GPU A)
  with basefold (GPU B) on multi-GPU. On one GPU both share the GPU — deferral
  buys no overlap, only the queue + re-upload penalty. The multi-GPU deferred
  path is untouched (the inline branch is `n_gpus==1 && gate` only).
- **Why byte-neutral.** The captured device traces are the same host source in
  the same col-major layout as the re-uploaded ones → identical reduce input →
  identical proof.
- **Measured** (tendermint 41-shard core, single-GPU, skip-verify, RTX 5090):
  - core proving wall: **~154.8 s → ~126.2 s (−28.6 s, −18.5%)** (3 runs each,
    zero overlap — ON worst < OFF best); GPU util 21% → 27%.
  - re-upload count **39 → 0**; net win exceeds the 20.3 s re-upload (also drops
    the host col-major transpose + serialization). Peak VRAM 26.3 GB = baseline
    (only 1 shard's traces resident), no OOM.
- **Validated byte-identical.**
  - fib core sha == golden `6278c091`; fib compress sha == `fb48a684`
    (default-on == `=0`-off).
  - goat single-GPU core sha `a7af7687` default(on) == off under
    `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`, coreVerify=1.
  - full-tendermint coreVerify: sha `32b38d48` (golden) + VERIFY OK.
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_SINGLE_GPU_INLINE_BASEFOLD` — default **on** (`n_gpus==1` only);
    set `=0` (kill-switch) for the legacy deferred + re-upload path.

## output_extract empty-chip skip — no full-cube eval for zero openings (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** In output_extract, chips that are unexercised on a shard (height 0,
  e.g. SyscallCore/SyscallInstrs/DivRem/CloClz on programs that don't hit them)
  still ran the SP1-parity full-point opening — `pm.eval_at` over the 2^22 cube
  (building the full eq-table) — for an opening that is provably the zero
  vector. `ZIREN_GPU_OE_EMPTY_SKIP` emits the zero vector directly for empty
  chips, skipping both the main- and full-point evals.
- **Why byte-neutral.** A zero-padded (height-0) MLE evaluates to 0 at any
  point, so the emitted zero vector equals the real eval bit-for-bit
  (asserted cell-by-cell under `ZIREN_GPU_OUTPUT_EXTRACT_VERIFY=1`, 0 mismatch).
- **Measured** (tendermint 41-shard core, single-GPU): output_extract
  **~4.09 s → ~2.86 s (~1.2 s)**; small (~1% core, within wall-noise) because
  the inline-basefold provider capture already routes the non-empty chips to the
  device path — this removes the residual empty-chip host waste.
- **Validated.** fib core `6278c091` + fib compress `fb48a684`; goat RAYON=1
  on==off `a7af7687`; full-TM coreVerify `32b38d48` + VERIFY OK.
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_OE_EMPTY_SKIP` — default **on**; `=0` restores the full eval.

## FRI query-open bulk gather — eliminate 2.1M tiny D2H copies (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** The FRI query-phase leaf-row openings in basefold-open pulled each
  opened felt to host **one at a time** (`for query { for leaf { for col in
  0..W { copy_device_to_host(1) } } }`) — ~2.1M tiny (median 640 ns) D2H copies
  per tendermint core proof, stalling the GPU on host round-trips (nsys: this
  was 100% of the core's tiny-scalar D2H). The single-leaf FRI-round path
  already had a byte-identical device bulk-gather (`device_leaf_row_openings`:
  one `gatherLeafRows` kernel + one bulk D2H); `ZIREN_GPU_FRI_QUERY_D2H_BULK`
  now extends it to both multi-leaf open paths (`component_poly_open_multi_leaf`
  + ROOTB codewords), per-felt fallback preserved.
- **Why byte-neutral.** The gather kernel copies the identical opened rows in
  the identical order; only the transport (one bulk D2H vs millions of 1-felt
  copies) changes.
- **Measured** (tendermint 41-shard core, single-GPU, RTX 5090):
  - basefold_open tiny D2H copies **2,123,872 → 0** (sync `cudaMemcpy`
    218,705 → 29).
  - core proving wall **~124.2 s → ~108.2 s (−16.0 s, −12.9%)** (3 runs, zero
    overlap). GPU util ~24% → ~27%.
- **Validated byte-identical.** fib core `6278c091` + fib compress `fb48a684`;
  goat RAYON=1 on==off `a7af7687`, coreVerify=1; full-TM coreVerify `32b38d48`
  + VERIFY OK.
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_FRI_QUERY_D2H_BULK` — default **on**; `=0` restores the per-felt
    copies.

## Giant FirstLayer slab — device-resident build, no per-shard re-upload (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** The giant nv=30 LogUp-GKR FirstLayer is `LayerState::Host`, so its
  jagged sumcheck slab was built by uploading the host numerator/denominator
  quadrant tables every shard (`build_jhr_slab_from_host_layer`, ~2.4 GB/shard,
  99.8 GB/run — the #1 layer_transitions H2D source). `ZIREN_GPU_FIRST_LAYER_SLAB_DEVICE`
  builds the slab from the device-resident first-layer stash instead:
  `peek_first_layer_stash` → `split_first_layer_device_from_buffers` → a
  base-field-aware inline-widen pack (new device F→Ef4 widen kernel folded into
  `build_jhr_slab_on_device`) → slab. No H2D. Byte-identical host fallback on
  any decline.
- **Why byte-neutral.** The device split (uninit-placeholder-fixed) and the
  device slab pack are the same math as the host path — asserted per-shard
  device-slab == host-slab (`ZIREN_GPU_JHR_SLAB_DEVICE_VERIFY`) during bring-up;
  only the transport (build-on-device vs upload-host-quadrants) changes.
- **Measured** (tendermint 41-shard, single-GPU, RTX 5090): eliminates the
  99.8 GB/run giant-layer H2D; total-wall ~377 s → ~359 s (−18 s; the
  core-prove share is larger, diluted by unchanged tracegen). Peak VRAM
  24.7–26.4 GB (< 32), no OOM.
- **Validated byte-identical.** fib core `6278c091` on==off; fib compress
  `fb48a684` on==off; goat RAYON=1 core `a7af7687` on==off (VERIFY OK); full-TM
  coreVerify `32b38d48` byte-identical across 3 runs.
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_FIRST_LAYER_SLAB_DEVICE` — default **on**; `=0` (kill-switch)
    restores the host-quadrant upload.

## Zerocheck fold — elide redundant per-round sync (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** The device-resident zerocheck sumcheck did **two** blocking
  `cudaStreamSynchronize` per round: one in `round_reduce` (before reading the
  2-element result to host for Fiat-Shamir — a genuine data dependency, kept)
  and one in `fold_msb` (after the in-place MSB fold). The `fold_msb` sync was
  **redundant**: same-stream ordering guarantees the next round's `round_reduce`
  reduce kernel (issued on the same `self.stream`) observes the fold's write,
  and the host-side buffer swap + `set_len` are pointer/length bookkeeping only.
  `ZIREN_GPU_ZEROCHECK_FOLD_NOSYNC` elides it — halving the per-round zerocheck
  blocking syncs.
- **Why byte-neutral.** Ordering-only change; the elided sync guarded nothing
  that CUDA same-stream ordering doesn't already guarantee. No math changes.
- **Measured.** Removes ~half of zerocheck's blocking `cudaStreamSynchronize`
  (profiled at ~12 K/run — the largest single sync source), directly attacking
  the ~22% of GPU-idle that is blocking syncs.
- **Validated byte-identical + deterministic.** fib core `6278c091` on==off;
  goat RAYON=1 gate-on ×3 all `a7af7687` == off (no async race); full-TM core
  `32b38d48` + CORE VERIFY OK.
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_ZEROCHECK_FOLD_NOSYNC` — default **on**; `=0` restores the
    per-round fold sync.

## Jagged fold+sum scratch pool — cut per-round cudaMallocAsync churn (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** The fused jagged LogUp-GKR fold+sum round fn
  (`gpu_jagged_circuit_fold_and_sum_resident`) allocated + freed 7 device
  scratch buffers (5 metadata uploads + `col_index` + `partials`) **every
  round** — the churniest safely-reusable `cudaMallocAsync` site in core
  proving. `ZIREN_GPU_BUFREUSE` adds a thread-local `JhrFoldScratch` pool
  (mirroring the zerocheck device-state pool) that reuses those buffers across
  rounds, rebuilding only on stream-handle change or capacity growth. The
  retained per-round output slab (`out_dev`, next round's input) and the
  retained layer-registry buffers are left freshly allocated (not poolable).
- **Why byte-neutral.** Reuse only — the kernel launch/readback path is
  identical between pooled and unpooled; metadata is refilled by H2D memcpy
  (no alloc). No math changes.
- **Measured** (goat 9-shard core, RAYON=1): total `cudaMallocAsync`
  **46,985 → 35,015 (−25.5%)**. The wall gain (~0.6 s) is below single-run
  noise; the value is the reduced allocation-API overhead (compounds with the
  other marshalling reductions). The mempool `release_threshold` is already
  `UINT64_MAX` (SP1-aligned), so this attacks the call *count*, not driver
  round-trips.
- **Validated byte-identical.** fib core `6278c091` on==off; goat RAYON=1 core
  `a7af7687` default(on) == `=0`(off), deterministic across runs; verify OK.
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_BUFREUSE` — default **on**; `=0` restores per-round allocation.

## GKR first-transition device-residency — no D2H round-trip (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** The first LogUp-GKR F→EF layer transition
  (`device_first_transition_native`) computes its output on-device
  (`transition_layer_first_device` returns a `DeviceEfLayer`) but then pulled
  every per-chip quadrant to host (D2H) to build a host `LogUpGkrCpuLayer`,
  which `try_run_device_path` immediately re-uploaded (H2D) to start the device
  layer walk — a redundant device→host→device round-trip.
  `ZIREN_GPU_FIRST_TRANSITION_DEVICE` keeps the transition output
  device-resident: it collects the per-chip `DeviceEfLayer`s (no pull), registers
  them directly in the layer registry via a new device-source init
  (`gpu_layer_init_from_device`, byte-identical to the host `gpu_layer_init_hook`
  path — same `pack_per_chip_to_wholesale` / `WholesaleSource::Init`), and threads
  the `(circuit_id, handle)` to `try_run_device_path` via a thread-local, which
  then skips its own upload + fit-preflight.
- **Why byte-neutral.** The device buffers moved into the registry are the exact
  transition output the host path would pull then re-upload (a lossless
  round-trip); the registry packed state is produced by the identical
  `pack_per_chip_to_wholesale`. This is the first slice of SP1's device-resident
  GKR layer model (`Tensor<_, TaskScope>` layers, no host round-trip).
- **Measured** (tendermint 41-shard core, single-GPU, skip-verify, 3 runs):
  - core proving wall **~249.3 s → ~219.0 s (−30.3 s, −12.2%)**, zero overlap
    (ON worst 224 s < OFF best 243 s).
- **Validated byte-identical.** fib core `6278c091` + fib compress `fb48a684`
  (default-on == `=0`-off); goat RAYON=1 core `a7af7687` on==off; full-TM
  coreVerify `32b38d48` + CORE VERIFY OK (giant nv=30 layer).
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_FIRST_TRANSITION_DEVICE` — default **on**; `=0` (kill-switch)
    restores the D2H-pull + H2D-reupload path.

## GKR first-layer stash-only host materialization — no D2H + no host MSB-split (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** On a fully device-stashed shard, `generate_first_layer_native` used to
  pull every per-chip first-layer quadrant to host (D2H) and run the host MSB-split
  to build the host `LogUpGkrCpuLayer` — even though the resident consumers
  (`device_first_transition` RESIDENT, the giant-slab `try_build_first_layer_slab_from_stash`,
  and the nv28 pack) already device-split the SAME stash buffers and read only the
  per-quadrant metadata (num_real_rows / num_interactions). `ZIREN_GPU_FIRST_LAYER_STASH_ONLY`
  builds a METADATA-ONLY host first layer (real dims derived from the resident stash
  buffer length; empty cells; no device split, no quadrant D2H) for every non-terminal
  Kb/Ef4 chip whose stash entry is valid, and fires the core-side full-table D2H skip
  (`first_layer_device_split_enabled`) on the same gate.
- **Why byte-neutral.** The empty host cells are produced ONLY when the shard is fully
  device-stashed — exactly when the device path handles it and never reads those cells
  (it reads only the stash metadata). A post-loop safety net checks
  `peek_first_layer_stash().len() == chips.len()`; any subset/mixed shard materializes the
  real quadrants from the SAME stash buffers via the device-split (HOSTPIECE) path — still
  no full-table D2H — before the giant-slab could read empty cells. Guarded to
  `num_row_variables >= 3` and `!FIRST_LAYER_VERIFY`. This captures the Phase-1 reducible
  host first-layer ceiling (~28.6 s / 41-shard TM: ie_d2h 14.0 s + host msb_split 14.6 s;
  ie_compute 12.4 s stays on-device, the part SP1 also pays).
- **Measured** (tendermint 41-shard core, single-GPU, skip-verify, 3 clean pairs):
  - core proving **208.9 s -> 174.4 s (-34.5 s, -16.5%)**, ~438 vs ~359 kHz; zero overlap
    (ON worst 176.1 s < OFF best 206.7 s). ~38/41 shards fully_stashed (win), 3 patched.
- **Validated byte-identical.** full-TM core `32b38d48` on==off (RAYON=1 isolating control
  + 5 default-rayon runs); goat RAYON=1 core `a7af7687` on==off + CORE VERIFY OK; fib core
  `6278c091` + fib compress `fb48a684` on==off.
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_FIRST_LAYER_STASH_ONLY` — default **on**; `=0` (kill-switch) restores the
    host first-layer D2H-pull + host MSB-split.
  - `ZIREN_IE_PROF` — byte-neutral profiling instrument (default off) splitting first-layer
    `interaction_eval` into device-compute vs D2H.

## Commit-MLE-resident open — SP1 drop-as-you-go input-stripe free (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** The `ZIREN_GPU_COMMIT_MLE_RESIDENT` open path (default on) borrowed ALL resident
  row-major input stripes for the whole reencode loop and materialized every col-major MLE +
  reencoded codeword at once, so its peak VRAM was (all input stripes) + (all outputs) —
  OOMing under tight/contended VRAM (the resident path has no host fallback by design).
  `ZIREN_GPU_MLE_RESIDENT_FREE_INPUT` CONSUMES each resident input stripe and frees it
  (stream-ordered `cudaFreeAsync` -> mempool) as soon as its col-major MLE + codeword are
  produced, so the reencode peak is (one input stripe) + outputs.
- **Why byte-neutral.** Identical `try_to_column_major` + `encode_batch_device_resident`
  kernels and values on every stripe; only the free timing changes — each stripe's outputs
  are produced before its input is freed, and stripes are independent. This aligns the
  resident open with SP1's `fri.rs`/`encoder.rs` discipline (drop codeword after commit under
  `drop_traces`, TaskScope pool reuse).
- **Measured.** Peak VRAM drops by the resident input-stripe footprint (frees each consumed
  stripe instead of holding the whole set), letting the resident open survive tighter VRAM.
- **Validated byte-identical.** fib core `6278c091` on==off; goat RAYON=1 core `a7af7687`
  on==off; full-TM core `32b38d48` on==off.
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_MLE_RESIDENT_FREE_INPUT` — default **on**; `=0` restores the hold-all borrow.

## ROOTB digest-resident commit — drop the bulk Merkle digest-layer D2H (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** The streaming dense commit's `finalize` copied EVERY device Merkle digest
  layer back to host (`digest_layers_dev.iter().map(|l| l.to_host()).collect()`,
  `basefold/src/commit_dense.rs`). Measured on tendermint core: **0.537 GB per shard,
  19.9 GB per run = 83% of ALL device→host traffic in the prover**, costing ~113 ms of
  the ~232 ms commit-dense hook — its single largest item, at a PCIe-saturated
  ~4.75 GB/s. Under ROOTB the commit now keeps only the layers small enough to be
  top-of-tree and leaves the bulk lower layers EMPTY on host.
- **Attribution note.** A prior investigation attributed this traffic to the codeword
  spill `leaves_host.push(codeword.to_host())` in the same file and believed
  `rootb_resident` was gated off. Both were wrong: `rootb_resident` is default-ON
  (`= streaming && open_path_device_enabled() && retain_enabled()`, the latter two
  default-true), which makes that `push` provably DEAD CODE — confirmed at runtime by
  `ZIREN_PROF=1` reporting `rootb=true, codeword_d2h_ms=0` on every shard. The bytes
  were always the digest-layer `collect`.
- **Why it was dead weight.** Under ROOTB the same layers are RETAINED device-side and
  handed to the open via `register_streaming_digests`, so every FRI sibling path is
  gathered on device. The host `MerkleTree` is already LEAFLESS there and touches only
  the TOP of the tree: `cap(0)` and `root()` both read `digest_layers.last()`, and
  `cap()` reads ONE layer, never a range. At `log_dense=29` the chain is 24 layers /
  512 MiB of which the host reads **32 bytes**; layer 0 alone is 256 MiB (one digest per
  codeword row).
- **Why byte-neutral.** Nothing on the host reads a skipped layer. The layer COUNT is
  preserved (empty `Vec`s hold the positions) so the `arity_schedule` derived from
  `host_digest_layers.len()` and every layer index are unchanged. The host MMCS
  `open_batch` fallback is unreachable under ROOTB and in any case panics on the empty
  `leaves` ("No committed matrices?") before it would index a digest layer, so the trim
  cannot turn a working path into a wrong one. The trim is conditioned on
  `rootb_resident`, so a regression to non-ROOTB (`ZIREN_GPU_OPEN_PATH_DEVICE=0` /
  `ZIREN_GPU_OPEN_DEVICE_RETAIN=0`) restores the full copy the then-live host
  `open_batch` needs; the legacy accumulate-all branch is untouched.
- **Measured** (tendermint core, `ZIREN_PROF=1`): `finalize` **113 → 2 ms/shard**,
  commit-dense hook **232 → 120 ms/shard (−48%)**, 508 MB/shard of D2H skipped
  (18.8 GB/run). **TM R16 kHz 1033.1 → 1137.3 (+10.1%)**, 3 paired concurrent reps,
  verify ON, zero overlap between arms (canon best 1078.2 < fix worst 1118.4).
  The kHz gain exceeds the ~6% the PCIe time alone predicts because the skipped
  `to_host()` also removes a 512 MB host `Vec` allocation + page-fault per shard.
- **Validated byte-identical** (host `c1723c31`, ziren-gpu `6daa39a`, isolating control
  vs canonical, verify ON): TM core `8b27f7e5ea510d95` (37 shards), goat core
  `a18399929adf02fa` (9 shards), fib core `6278c091f7e8bd91` — all canon == fix.
  RAYON>1 race check: TM R8 ×3 all == R1 sha, all verify OK.
  Recursion checked too (core-only validation cannot see a recursion regression):
  fib **compress** `68ed25eb3ab496f4` canon == fix, COMPRESS VERIFY OK both arms.
- **Switches.**
  - `ZIREN_GPU_ROOTB_HOST_DIGEST_MAX` — per-layer digest-count threshold, default
    **65536** (2 MiB); `=0` restores the full host copy for A/B parity.
  - `ZIREN_GPU_STREAMING_COMMIT_PARITY=1` asserts the host copy of every layer against a
    rebuilt legacy tree, so the full copy is kept automatically whenever it is armed.

## Device-chip host trace regen — run it concurrently with the GPU commit (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** After `commit` returns, `prove_one_core_shard`
  (`prover/src/core_multi_gpu.rs`) builds the BaseFold snapshot, and every
  device-generated chip (one whose trace was produced by `generate_trace_device`
  and therefore has no host copy) has its host trace RE-MATERIALIZED on CPU by
  `regen_one` → `MachineAir::generate_trace`. On tendermint core R16 that is
  **19 of 20 chips, 1.47 GiB and 132 ms per shard (4.9 s/run)**, and it runs with
  the GPU IDLE: single-GPU runs take the inline-basefold path, so the pool worker
  cannot start the next shard's commit until the regen finishes. It is now
  started CONCURRENTLY with the GPU commit and handed to the classify pass.
- **Why it cannot just be deleted.** The regen exists because the device-fold
  sentinel (which replaces a device chip's host trace with an empty matrix) is
  disabled whenever `cluster_widths.is_some()` — the FIX-off natural-commit path,
  which is what tendermint/goat run. Confirmed at runtime:
  `cdf=true, np_prep=true, provider_names=20, want_dt=true` but
  `cluster_widths.is_some()=true`, so the sentinel arm never fires and all 19
  device chips take the `generate_trace` arm. Under FIX-on the sentinel empties
  them, so the pre-regen is skipped there (it would be pure waste).
- **Why a DEDICATED pool, on a scoped OS thread.** The first attempt used
  `rayon::join(commit, pre_regen)` on the global pool and measured **net zero**
  (TM kHz 1169.8 → 1160.4). Sub-instrumentation showed exactly why: over the
  first 9 shards, canonical was `stark_commit 2398 ms + regen 1205 ms = 3603 ms`
  and the `rayon::join` build was `stark_commit 3615 ms + regen 17 ms` — the regen
  time moved wholesale INTO `commit`, with zero overlap. `commit` drives its
  per-chip H2D copies and `generate_trace_device` dispatch through `par_iter` on
  the global pool, so a co-scheduled regen starves the device dispatch of workers
  by exactly what the overlap would save. Running the regen on its own
  `rayon::ThreadPool` from a `std::thread::scope` thread leaves the global pool
  free and the overlap materializes.
- **Why byte-neutral.** Every chip in `machine.shard_chips(&record)` is by
  definition `included(&record)`, so `regen_one`'s height-0 cluster arm cannot
  apply to it and the pre-regenerated matrix is exactly what its `generate_trace`
  arm would have produced — same pure call, same `ExecutionRecord`, which `commit`
  only borrows. The map is consulted only where the original code would have
  regenerated (`host.or_else(...)`, after the sentinel check), so a chip absent
  from it takes the original inline path unchanged.
- **Measured** (tendermint core R16, verify ON, 3 paired concurrent reps on
  separate GPUs): per-shard regen **4.2-4.9 s/run → 5-27 ms/run**.
  **TM kHz 1215.6/1137.5/1226.9 → 1346.4/1299.9/1226.6, mean 1193.3 → 1291.0
  (+8.2%)**; the removed 4.5 s of a ~60 s proving wall predicts +7.5%, so the
  measurement is exactly the mechanism. goat core, 3 paired reps:
  **306.0/288.2/… → 323.2/311.3/… (+5.6%, +8.0%)**. Peak VRAM unchanged
  (TM 29053/27645/27389 → 28829/26973/27933 MiB).
- **Validated byte-identical** (isolating control vs canonical, verify ON,
  ziren-gpu `55ff0fa` base): TM core `8b27f7e5ea510d95` (37 shards), goat core
  `a18399929adf02fa` (9 shards), fib core `6278c091f7e8bd91` — all canon == fix,
  every run CORE VERIFY OK. Recursion gate (core-only validation cannot see a
  recursion regression): fib **compress** `68ed25eb3ab496f4` canon == fix, both
  arms COMPRESS VERIFY OK. RAYON>1 race check: TM R8 ×3 + goat R8 ×3 all == the
  R16 sha, all verify OK.
- **Switches.** None — the path is unconditional, gated only on the structural
  predicate `cluster_widths.is_some() || !core_device_fold_enabled()` (i.e. only
  where the regen would actually have run). `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` sizes the
  dedicated pool.

## Per-shard host trace store — free it on a reaper thread (ziren-gpu)

- **What.** `prove_shard_to_basefold_with_provider`
  (`shard-prover/src/lib.rs`) owns the shard's host trace store — the
  `BTreeMap<String, PaddedMle>` handed in on `ShardProveData::main_traces` plus
  the `shared_trace_mles` view of it. On tendermint core that is **1.47 GiB per
  shard**, and dropping it at the end of the call costs **70 ms/shard
  (2.6 s/run)** of single-threaded page teardown ON THE CALLER. Single-GPU runs
  take the inline-basefold path, so that is 70 ms/shard with the GPU idle before
  the next shard's commit can start. The store is now handed to a dedicated
  reaper thread (`core/src/reaper.rs`) so the teardown overlaps the next shard's
  device work.
- **How it was found.** Sub-instrumenting the whole per-shard path showed
  `B4_bf_prove` (1070.0 ms/shard) exceeded the sum of its own stages
  (`C0..C8` = 1010.2 ms/shard) by 59.8 ms/shard with nothing in between; adding an
  explicit `drop` mark accounted for all of it (`CA_trace_store_drop`
  69.8 ms/shard, n=37).
- **Why byte-neutral.** A pure lifetime change: the value is dropped exactly
  once, on another thread, slightly later. Nothing in the prove path reads it
  after this point (the borrowed `commit_traces` / `eager_device_remat` views are
  dropped first, in order). The queue is bounded at 2, and a full queue falls
  back to the inline drop, so pending host RAM is bounded by two shards' stores
  and the path degrades to the previous behaviour rather than growing.
- **MEASURED NEGATIVE first — glibc allocator tuning.** Recorded so it is not
  retried. `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=2 GiB` + `MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_=2 GiB` (the
  gate binary links plain glibc malloc, no jemalloc) was expected to keep the
  ~19 × 77 MiB regions on the heap instead of `munmap`ing them. It did nothing:
  `CA_trace_store_drop` **69.8 → 76.2 ms/shard** (worse) and TM kHz
  **1292.2 → 1281.2**. The teardown is not `malloc_trim`; it is the page work
  itself, which is why moving it to another core is what pays.
- **Measured** (tendermint core R16, verify ON, 3 paired concurrent reps on
  separate GPUs, measured ON TOP of the regen-overlap lever):
  **kHz 1332.8/1280.2/1265.3 → 1389.2/1357.7/1349.0, mean 1292.8 → 1365.3
  (+5.6%)**, zero overlap between arms (base best 1332.8 < fix worst 1349.0).
  The removed 2.6 s of a ~58 s proving wall predicts +4.4%. Peak VRAM unchanged
  (27901/27901/28029 → 29021/28125/28445 MiB, inside the canonical run-to-run
  spread of 27389-29053).
- **Validated byte-identical** (isolating control, verify ON): TM core
  `8b27f7e5ea510d95` in all 6 runs, goat core `a18399929adf02fa`, fib core
  `6278c091f7e8bd91`; RAYON>1 race check TM R8 ×3 + goat R8 ×3 all == the R16 sha.
- **Switches.** None; `REAPER_QUEUE` (const, 2) bounds the in-flight junk.

## MEASURED NEGATIVE — batching the per-column `eval_at` dot launches (ziren-gpu)

Recorded so it is not retried blind. `eval_columns_with_eq_raw`
(`core/src/basefold/batched_trace_eval.rs`) issues one
`dot_product_base_ef_koala_bear` launch per trace column — ~1900 launches/shard, each
into a grid capped at 64 blocks = 26% of the 170 SMs — which looks like an obvious
launch-storm/occupancy win. It is not.

A byte-identical batched kernel (`dotProductBaseEfChipBatched`, column index carried in
`blockIdx.y`, so a chip is ONE launch of `width * gridSize` blocks; `gridDim.x` and
therefore the grid-stride slice, the per-block tree reduction, and the
`col * MAX_DOT_GRID_SIZE + blockIdx.x` output slot are all unchanged) reproduced every
golden — TM core `8b27f7e5ea510d95`, goat `a18399929adf02fa`, fib `6278c091f7e8bd91` —
but measured **kHz 1104.9 → 1085.8, mean −1.7%** over 3 paired concurrent reps
(−0.8%, −5.9%, +1.8%; arms overlapping). The launches evidently are not on the critical
path, so removing their overhead buys nothing and the wider grid appears to cost a little
locality. Not landed.
